![alt text](docs/Transaction_Costs.png "Transaction Costs")

## Prerequisites

- This project utilizes coinmarketcap api to fetch and calculate actual gas costs for transactions.
- This project use polygon scan api to verify contract sourcecode after publishing to network
- This project uses alchemy as an RPC provider and ledger gateway

- Create an account on https://coinmarketcap.com/api/ . Get an api Key
- Create an account on https://polygonscan.com/register . Get an api key
- Create an account on https://www.alchemy.com/ . Create a new application and fetch an api key

## Configuration
- Create a .env file in your project
- Contents of the .env file should be as below
```
PUBLIC_KEY=<Public Address from metamask>
PRIVATE_KEY=<Private key from metamask>
POLYGON_SCAN_KEY=<Polygon scan API key>
ALCHEMY_KEY=<Alchemy API key>
COINMARKETCAP_KEY=<Coinmarket cap API key>
```
